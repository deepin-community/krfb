Description: Desktop Sharing utility
 KDE Desktop Sharing is a manager for easily sharing a desktop session with
 another system.  The desktop session can be viewed or controlled remotely by
 any VNC or RFB client, such as the KDE Remote Desktop Connection client.
 .
 KDE Desktop Sharing can restrict access to only users who are explicitly
 invited, and will ask for confirmation when a user attempts to connect.
 .
 This package is part of the KDE networking module.
